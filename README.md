## Features

1. A book catalogue with search by name, author and category of the books.  Note there may  be more than one copy of each book, and a book may even be published by different  publishers. 
2. The ability to deactivate a patron’s account if he/she does not return books after a specific period of time passes. 
3. Records of books checked out as well as placed on hold (i.e. “reserved” by a patron to make sure the book is there when he/she gets to the library to check it out). 
4. Notifications when the desired book becomes available and reminders that a book should be returned to the library.  Both could be sent by email and/or when patron logs in to the LMS. 
5. Provide analysis report to management to review the system.
